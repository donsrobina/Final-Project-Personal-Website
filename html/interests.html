<p>I love fishing, crabbing and all kinds of seafood. What's the best way to have all of them? Well I figured since I have the passion of fishing, 
then why not catch them and eat them. I have also created a youtube page to show the local fishing spots nearby our area. I go by the name of Noob Fisherman
since my skill level is considered a Noob. Please check out my page and dont forget to follow and subscribe.

<p>Photography is also a great passion of mine. The art of capturing the perfect picture and saving the moment with a memorable image is my goal. 
I have no professional experience as a photographer but I taught myself the basic in terms of proper lighting. People will call or label my as an amateur photographer
because of my background but I can still capture great images. My favorite model right now is my son and I cant seem to get enought picture of him.

<p>Me and my son always hangs out since I take care of him during the day. Being a father is a great gift and a blessing. It feels like not too long ago that I can hold him 
in one hand but now he is getting so big. For all the new Dads out there. Time goes by fast and enjoy every moment with your little one. It's a huge responsibility and difficult at 
times but everything is worth it at the end of the day.

<div class="item1"><h2 style="text-align:center;"><a id="games">Games</a></h2>
<p>I also love video games. Luckily I dont own any console systems anymore and only focuses on PC games. The only game I play at the moment is League of Legends and I am not really good at it.
I still play it because its fun and hopefully I can teach my son in the future if it is still around. Maybe he has the skills to be an ESPORTS player someday.
