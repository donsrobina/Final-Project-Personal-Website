CIS 241 Web Development has been a great class. I dont have a background in Computer Science of Computer Information system but knowing the basics
about computers is not that hard. This class has been easy to understand even with my lack of knowleadge on computer programing. There are great 
resources out there as well specially in todays day and age that if you are stuck on a problem, you can always find the answers online.

The type of work and jobs that I had for the last 12 years has been in the hotel business. I went back to school to be a web developer and this is the
first class I registered. Before choosing another career path, I remember a moment in my High School days where I was in a computer class. There was a moment
where I remembered creating a hyperlink and clicking on it to transfer me to another page. And then it all made sense, that moment did leave behind a 
memory and feeling of facination towards creating websites.

Learning CSS is the same as HTML5. It was difficult to understand at first but if you just link everthing to your HTML5 codes then its like lego pieces coming together.
My knowleadge on CSS is pretty limited but knowing the basics and being able to apply CSS to this website sure does feel good. I will keep learning 
and with more practice, I am sure I can build a much better website than this one.
